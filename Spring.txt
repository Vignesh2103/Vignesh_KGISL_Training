Spring Bean:
	*A Spring bean is a reusable and managed object instance that is created, configured, and assembled by the Spring IoC container.
	
component scan
	In the context of Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container, a "component scan" is a way of automatically detecting and registering Spring-managed components (such as beans) in your application context.
	@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
	
Ioc Container:
	Bean Model+Meta Data}----> Reday to use object

In a Java web application, both ContextListener and ContextLoaderListener are used to handle events related to the ServletContext. However, there are some differences between the two:

ContextListener:
	ContextListener is an interface defined in the javax.servlet package
	
	it is used to handle events related to the ServletContext. 
	
	ContextListener has two methods: contextInitialized() and contextDestroyed()
	
	contextInitialized() is called when the web application is deployed and the ServletContext is created
	
	This method is typically used to perform initialization tasks such as setting up database connections, creating caches, and initializing global variables.
	
	contextDestroyed() is called when the web application is undeployed or the ServletContext is destroyed. 
	
	This method is typically used to perform cleanup tasks such as closing database connections and releasing resources.

ContextLoaderListener:
	ContextLoaderListener is a class defined in the Spring Framework, and it is used to load a Spring ApplicationContext in a web application. 
	
	ContextLoaderListener extends ContextLoader, which is responsible for loading the ApplicationContext from the specified configuration file(s).

	ContextLoaderListener has one method: contextInitialized(), which is called when the ServletContext is initialized.
	
	This method creates and initializes the ApplicationContext and stores it as a context attribute so that it can be accessed by other components in the web application.

	the main difference between ContextListener and ContextLoaderListener 
	ContextListener is a standard Java interface used to handle events related to the ServletContext, 
	while ContextLoaderListener is a class defined in the Spring Framework used to load a Spring ApplicationContext in a web application.
